Last month, on Thursday, September 22 I attended the third annual [Beyond the Code](http://beyondthecode.io)!
This was the first year it was held in Toronto, and the organizers picked a cool venue: 99 Sudbury St.
We were welcomed to a warehouse that was decorated with lines of colourful yarn, a cute swag bag,
and a small pastry breakfast. I appreciate these little things. 🛍🎁

Beyond the Code was started by Anna Lambert, the Director of Talent Acquisition at Shopify,
when she noticed that she was seeing very few female speakers at tech conferences.
After asking organizers why this was the case, she got answers like "We couldn't find anyone".
So Anna set out to prove that one could organize a tech conference with _all_ female speakers.

# Mentorship
The themes this year included diversity, inclusion, and mentorship.
Leading up to the conference, I was looking forward to the mentorship aspect of the conference.
There was an option to place a pink triangle on your name tag to indicate your interest in mentoring,
and a small area for mentoring conversations to take place.
However, I found that the day was so jam-packed that it was tough to take a moment to find the small pink triangled names,
much less strike up a serious conversation about mentorship with anyone.

### Agenda
So let's get to the talks! Aside from the keynote and panel, there were two tracks this year.
Here's how my day went:
  - Keynote by Atlee Clark
  - Building a Diverse Corporate Culture by Erica Baker
  - break to reflect on Erica's talk
  - CSS vs. My Gender by Jamie Chung
  - Delicious lunch and visiting the Actua table
  - Workshop: How to Contribute to Apache Spark Holden Karau
  - Sandi Metz (A repeat talk for me)
  - Dipping Your Toes in Internet Security by Florencia Herra-Vega
  - Networking at the Drake Hotel

# Keynote by [Atlee Clark](https://twitter.com/atleeclark)
Atlee talked about the [Wheel of Diversity](http://web.jhu.edu/sebin/t/m/DiversityWheel_Small.jpg).
She explained how she uses it as a tool to check how your team is doing in terms of diversity.
I had heard of the Wheel of Diversity before, but Atlee suggested using it to find out two things:
  - what perspectives you bring to the table
  - how your team is sliced with respect to the perspectives in the wheel

All this, in three easy steps!
1. Map out your perspectives
2. Choose one colour to represent your perspectives
3. Colour in your team's perspectives, with each colour representing a different perspective

Atlee mentioned that it's okay to empty spaces if you don't know,
because in the end, the exercise is meant to take one kind of snapshot of your team's diversity.
This can point out which areas you might want to work on in future hires
or to highlight perspectives that may not have as many voices behind them.
She used this to help her make decisions in creating a new team.

# Building a Diverse Corporate Culture by [Erica Baker](https://twitter.com/EricaJoy)
_"Diversity is who is invited to the party, and inclusion is who feels comfortable there."_
This talk was my favourite of the day. Erica spoke about her experiences in years of Diversity & Inclusion work.
She asked many of the tough questions. Here are some of the highlights for me.

She began by talking about finding out that she was being paid significantly less than the other female engineers at her company.
Armed with Fair Pay information and negotiation tactics, she asked her boss for a raise. He said no.
But the heartbreaking part was that he said "We're already paying a premium for your diversity work."
For a company that is touted for being [great for diversity](https://www.wired.com/2016/02/slack-wants-to-be-more-diverse-as-it-grows-fast/), I can't believe this. I'm also not that surprised.
My first  manager told me, proudly, "Two women is already many more than the other teams here."

It's not just bosses either. _"You can't pay rent with exposure."_
This quote is a response to all the conference organizers that have offered Erica exposure or a gift card for speaking.

The talk also highlighted the points where people are complacent to stop pushing for change.
For every company that says "We value diversity and inclusion.", Erica wants us to ask "But how much?"
Are there women or people of colour at the executive level? Are you promoting the ideas of minorities?
Can you think of more than one company that doesn't fail at just those two questions?

Another thing that Erica stressed is that change is not free, *What are you willing to give up?*
Shares? Pay? Productivity of the "superstar" that's toxic to everyone else?
Is performance worth more than how your employees feel?
Do you even know how your employees are feeling?
That last question is especially important to me with respect to retention.
If you don't even know that your employees feel that they're in a toxic environment, how can you keep them?

Perhaps my favourite part of the talk was the explanation of sponsorship vs. mentorship.
Mentorship is teaching someone, showing them which paths they can take.
On the other hand, sponsorship is where your sponsor puts themselves out there to make sure your voice is being heard,
that you're being considered for leadership positions, etc.

Overall, this talk left me feeling a lot of emotions--some anger, some helplessness, some hope--but now I'm also armed with plenty of tough questions to ask.

# CSS vs. My Gender by [Jamie Chung](https://twitter.com/attnjamie)
This talk was quick contrast between CSS transitions and gender transitions.
My favourite ideas from the talk:
- you can't be more or less trans based on your presentation or physical changes
- allying is a journey, just like being trans is a journey
- when you're supporting a minority group:
  - ask what they need
  - ask if you can help
  - if not, step aside
- transforming instinctive apologies into thanks
  - ex: "Sorry for being late" -> "Thank you for being patient"
- would you rather be right or have resolution?

# Lunch and [Actua](www.actua.ca/) table
Lunch was this yummy feta-topped salad with pulled pork sandwich. Delish!
Apparently good food is a Shopify conference standard.
I was also able to try out these toys at the Actua table:
- [Cubelets](http://www.modrobotics.com/cubelets/)
- [Ozorobots](http://ozobot.com/)
- [Makey Makey](http://makeymakey.com/)
- [Little Bits](http://littlebits.cc/)

I'd never seen the first two before, and now I'm tempted to buy my own...
I might have a weakness for educational tech toys.

# Workshop: How to Contribute to Apache Spark with [Holden Karau](https://twitter.com/holdenkarau)
Holden was a quirky but fun speaker, with cute cat gifs!
Unfortunately, I think most people weren't familiar enough with Spark to actually follow along with the workshop, me included.
The rows of chairs weren't exactly conducive to working on your laptop either.
A few things that I took away from the talk:
- You can start with documentation improvements to get to know change reviewers
- Issue creators are often bad at labelling beginner-level fixes/features
- Open source changes may take long conversations to be accepted

# Madame Sandi Tells Your Future by [Sandi Metz](https://twitter.com/sandimetz)
I'd actually already seen this at CUSEC 2015, so instead of taking notes, all I have are some messy sketches.

If you can find this talk online, please, please watch it! Sandi walks you through the history of recorded information,
and moves to what we can be doing in the future. It's a battle-cry to spend time doing the right things.

# Dipping Your Toes in Internet Security by [Florencia Herra-Vega](https://twitter.com/flohdot)
By this talk, I was getting pretty tired, and it turns out I was familiar with the topics: DNS and cache poisoning!
Although I didn't follow along closely, I enjoyed the fact that Flo presented it in an accessible way,
using Harry Potter characters and diagrams to help her explain things.
It was so refreshing to have someone who wanted to teach security in an approachable way.

### Talks I missed
- Thriving in a Hacker Culture - Andrea Van Leeuwen
- Fireside Chat with Janet Bannister
- The Broken Promise of Open Source - Coraline Ada
- Walking in Both Worlds - Gabrielle Fayant
- Workshop: Modes - A new method for system design with Normative
- Three Ways YOU can Influence Girls with the Power of Technology - Sabrina Geremia

### Final Thoughts
I wish there were more technical talks. I don't think I'll be back next year unless this is the case. Hopefully going to Grace Hopper NEXT WEEK will satisfy my wish to see women in tech talking about tech!
