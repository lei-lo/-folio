On Monday, September 12, I hosted my ninth
[Ottawa Ladies Code Club](https://www.meetup.com/Ottawa-Ladies-Code-Club/)!
Around twenty women attended, from students to freelancers to true beginners.
We talked about our different tech backgrounds, learning resources for new coders,
upcoming local tech events, and more. At some point we also devoured some yummy
cheesecake. But the best part was just being around women with similar interests
to mine.

I started this meetup with selfish intentions: I wanted to hang out with more
women in tech, especially coders. When I was still a student in Montreal, I had
places to do this-at school and at
[Montreal Pyladies](http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesMTL/)
(despite not being much of a Python girl). But once I started working, there were
only a handful of women at my job to talk to. I tried meeting people at other
meetups but that also proved difficult. So I decided to create my own community.

Most of the time we just sit, chat, and snack. The format was partly inspired by
[this post](http://jvns.ca/blog/2012/12/16/all_girl_hack_night/). I like letting
people talk and code if they want to. In the beginning, I tried to organize
things for people to code but in the end, most of the women come to talk and
listen. [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/) has been perfect for organizing things.
Without much effort on my part, the group has grown to 257 coders. Each meetup
ends up having a cozy attendance of 10-20 women.

So if you're in Ottawa, come [join us](http://www.meetup.com/Ottawa-Ladies-Code-Club/events/233737429/) for the tenth edition and beyond!
