Welcome! My name is Lei (\ˈlā\) and I started this blog to have a place to share things I'm excited about in tech.
For starters, I love emoji✌️, Lua 🌝, and attempts to translate tech words (fyi, mot-clic == hashtag in French).
<br/>
<br/>
I did the degree thing in Computer Science in Montreal. Now I'm at Shopify working on things that make our developers lives better.
<br/>
<br/>
I was inspired by in part by these Candians girls: <a href="https://girlknowstech.com/en">Marie</a>, <a href="https://jvns.ca">Julia</a>, and <a href="https://meowni.ca">Monica</a>.
